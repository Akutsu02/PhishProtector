# PhishProtector
This is a project to create an anti-phishing solution.
 
## Description

PhishProtector is a software designed to protect users against phishing attacks. Phishing is a technique used by malicious individuals to obtain confidential information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, etc., by pretending to be a legitimate entity.

Our software uses a combination of advanced techniques to detect phishing attempts and proactively alert users. It analyzes URLs, source code, and web pages to identify telltale signs of phishing, such as misspellings in domain names, suspicious links, and requests for sensitive information through insecure means.

## Objective

- Advanced detection of phishing attempts with a AI model in ML.net
- Analysis of URLs, source code, and web pages
- Proactive warnings to users in case of phishing threats
- Regular updates of the known phishing sites database
- User-friendly and easy-to-use interface

 
## Usage

1. Windows software that analyzes information
2. A browser extension that will retrieve site information and warn the user in case of danger
